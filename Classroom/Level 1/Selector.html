    <p class="myClass">Unwanted Access: It could refer to gaining unauthorized access to someone's computer network or 
        device, similar to trespassing in the physical world. This access could be achieved through various 
        means like using someone else's Wi-Fi without permission, exploiting vulnerabilities in their system, 
        or social engineering tactics. It's important to note that such actions are illegal and violate individual 
        privacy.
        </p>

    <p class="myClass">Stealthy Cyberattacks: In a broader sense, it might also be used to describe the stealthy nature of 
        certain cyberattacks. Attackers often employ techniques to conceal their activities, making them 
        difficult to detect and prevent. This can involve using sophisticated malware, exploiting zero-day 
        vulnerabilities, and actively covering their tracks.</p>
